# git-githubCourseNotes

This repo includes some notes I took while taking a Git &amp; Github Course.

Course Link(in Turkish) : https://www.btkakademi.gov.tr/portal/course/versiyon-kontrolleri-git-ve-github-19439

Special thanks to the lecturer of this course Atıl Samancıoğlu. He explained a topic every programmer should know in a very clear and understandable way.


PS: Sorry about using two languages in files. I couldn't decide which one to use at the beginning, since the course is in Turkish but I mostly use English on Github.

PS2: Sorry if i had a mistake or a curse in my notes, i haven't checked them before uploading them into Github.

PS3: Although I typed my notes into python files, there's no pieces of codes in this project. And you don't need to know any programming language to take this course.
